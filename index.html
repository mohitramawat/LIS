                        The Hon’ble Chairman, Shri S.N Kachhwaha- visionary extraordinaire, philanthropist, social
                        reformer,

                        At LIS, the children are the soul of our
                        foundation; the child in blue signifies the pristine
                        innocence of youth, the quill is a traditional writing instrument which depicts the love for
                        heritage and culture, and it is this marriage of the traditional and modern- which founds the
                        basis of our teaching methodologies and pedagogical practices. The open book implies the journey
                        the scholar is embarking upon, to explore oneself and the world-penning their experiences on the
                        blank pages. The lone star in the sky is the zenith which one needs to be in pursuit of
                        constantly-it sets the mark that the child must try to achieve, through exploration,
                        self-discovery and student led practices. The laurel wreath is an ancient Greek insignia for the

                    Jodhpur is synonymous
                    for its royal heritage, and the landmark monuments which adorn its desert
                    landscape; it therefore seemed a befitting tribute to the Sun City, to have a structure steeped in
                    the local heritage, yet one which comfortably spanned across cultures. Inspired by the opulent and
                    majestic architectural style from the Beaux Arts, the façade is complete with rotundas which mark
                    the skyline from the NH 112; a marriage of the Indo Gothic and European styles, the exteriors offer
                    an insight of just how grandiose the interiors would be! The interiors are a refreshing change from
                    the formal exteriors, they exude an air of elegance and much needed sense of coolness from the
                    scorching heat of the Sun City! Equipped with sophisticated technological aids, the Scholar Block
                    houses five floors which include the Co Learning Arena (spaced over the basement and mezzanine
                    floors), the PPY, PY & Middle School and Senior School classrooms, with laboratories and libraries
                    spread over the remainder. The 24X7 electronic surveillance includes traditional yet modern security
                    hardware, in keeping with the need of the hour, the gates are manned round the clock by security
                    personnel. Classrooms have CCTV cameras installed with a view to discourage any untoward incidents.

                    When one steps into the fountain ensconced portico of the School, one cannot help but feel part of
                    the “olde worlde” charm of marbled staircase, gushing water, fringed with the greens of the Phoenix
                    Sylvestris.Walking up the stairs, to the left lies the Scholar Block- one is pleasantly surprised by
                    the stark yet refreshing difference in the treatment of the interiors. A soothing contrast in muted
                    whites and tan, punctuated with colourful flower pots, the corridors are flooded with pristine light
                    from the panelled LED lighting, not making one miss natural light.The entire block spans three
                    floors, excluding the mezzanine and basement floors. The first floor houses the overhanging library,
                    which connects the Scholar and Administrative Blocks.
                    Each classroom is equipped with air conditioning, LED light panels, boards with smart projectors and
                    state of the art sound systems.

                    A unique thing about the teaching system of the school is its TAB education. At LIS, students are
                    relieved of the physical burden of carrying hard copy books. Instead, they carry their books in a
                    tab digitally. It helps them in two ways – first, they get all their study materials in one light
                    weight tab; second, they get very much trained in using the modern gadgets as this is the future of
                    learning. LIS TEACH, the software used for the TAB-education is very efficient and makes the
                    students comfortable with the digital mode of learning. The tab also helps them to interact directly
                    with the teachings in the class through the real-time synchronization.
                    VIDEOS – Indigenous videos for each topic is created and shared with the students along with the
                    academic content of each subject. These videos are created in house incorporating the AR and VR
                    technology. This helps the students to understand the complex concepts in simple terms and in a
                    practical way.
